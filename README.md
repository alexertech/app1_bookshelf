Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.4)

irb(main):001:0> Book.all

  Book Load (0.8ms)  SELECT  "books".* FROM "books" LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 11]]
=> #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Book id: 1, name: "1984", author: "George Orwell", created_at: "2017-10-19 23:46:52", updated_at: "2017-10-19 23:46:52">, #<Book id: 2, name: "Zen principle", author: "Osho", created_at: "2017-10-19 23:46:52", updated_at: "2017-10-19 23:46:52">, #<Book id: 3, name: "The White Cat and the Monk", author: "Jo Ellen Bogart", created_at: "2017-10-19 23:46:52", updated_at: "2017-10-19 23:46:52">]>

irb(main):002:0> Book.first

  Book Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "books".* FROM "books" ORDER BY "books"."id" ASC LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 1]]
=> #<Book id: 1, name: "1984", author: "George Orwell", created_at: "2017-10-19 23:46:52", updated_at: "2017-10-19 23:46:52">
irb(main):003:0> 
```

Now the controller to put some life in our model:

`$ rails generate controller Books`

Add the *index action* at **app/controllers/book_controller.rb**:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

    def index
    end

end
```

Create a view **app/views/books/index.html.erb**:

```
<% Book.all.each do |bk| %>

    - Name: <%=bk.name%>, Author <%=bk.author%> <br>

<% end %>
```

Add the route so Rails can understand where and how is things connected:

Edit **config/routes.rb** and add:

```rb
get '/books', to: 'books#index'
```

We define the method, then the URL and finally the controller and action.

Run the Rails server on your application:

`$ rails s`

Go to your browser and access: `http://localhost:3000/books`

Do you see the list? :)
